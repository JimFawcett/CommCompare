# CommCompare

https://JimFawcett.github.io/CommCompare.html

Compare synchronous message-passing communication systems written in Rust and C++.  
- These projects use synchronous bilateral socket communication between connectors and listeners, sending variable size messages to and from both endpoints.
- The designs using Rust and C++ are as similar as practical and tested in the same way.
- Performances of the two are very close on Windows and Linux, using both native hosting and virtual machines.
- This repository contains links to repositories holding the code:  

https://github.com/JimFawcett/RustCommExperiments  
https://github.com/mwcorley79/MPL  

Build instructions are provided in each of those repositories Read.me files.
